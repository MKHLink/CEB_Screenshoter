# CEB_Screenshoter

## Description
A handy script I wrote that goes through a website and takes screenshot while clicking next and loops until it reaches the end 

## Directions

Clone the repo to your local machine and the navigate to the directory in your command line. Provided you have Node.js installed, 
first type in "npm i" in order to install the dependencies. Once complete, go over the script file, and follow the instructionos in the comments.
You might need to change the page links and the page.click selectors depending on the webpage you are trying to take a screenshot off of. The selectors can 
be view using the chrome dev tools.
